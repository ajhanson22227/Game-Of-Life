# Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is considered a zero player game consisting of a grid of cells that have only two possible states: alive or dead. 

As the game goes on, a cell's state changes if it matches certain criteria.
* A cell dies if it has fewer than 2 alive neighbors or more than 3 neighbors.
* A cell remains alive if it has only 2-3 alive neighbors.
* A cell comes back to life if it has *exactly* 3 alive neighbors.
